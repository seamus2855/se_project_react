# WTWR (What to Wear?)(se_project_react)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user. Using the figma to see what has to be incorporated. We add each section using react and then add different parts to each other. We worked on adding different style to the page.
